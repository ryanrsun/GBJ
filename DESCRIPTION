Description: Offers the Generalized Berk-Jones (GBJ) test for set-based inference in genetic    
    association studies. The GBJ is designed as an alternative to tests such as Berk-Jones (BJ),
    Higher Criticism (HC), Generalized Higher Criticism (GHC), Minimum p-value (minP), and SKAT.  
    All of these other methods (except for SKAT) are also implemented in this package, and we 
    additionally provide an omnibus test (OMNI) which integrates information from each of the tests.
    The GBJ has been shown to outperform other tests in genetic association studies when signals
    are correlated and moderately sparse. For more details, please ask for a preprint of the 
    manuscript (Sun and Lin, "The Generalized Berk-Jones Statistic for Genetic Association Studies,"
    Submitted"), or see the vignette for a quickstart guide.
